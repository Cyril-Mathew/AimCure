## Project summary
I have designed a website using Bootstrap for the purpose of helping the underprivileged section of the society. Initially the site will help with the collection of the fund. Later on, the site can be developed to track people with different ailments and help them. Store the records for future reference. The site is hosted on two different servers(US & Asia) so that there is no lag when people from outside India access the website. The client will be redirected to his/her server according to the geography. This is done so that everyone in the world can help in any manner without getting frustrated by the buffer/loading time that they experience on any site. With increasing traffic, the site will be scaled up. This is a small step but there is a scope of improvement as and when I develop my cloud knowledge. There are two different flows in the website that can be tried out. 1) Home > Learn More > "Check the server (if in US, us server will be displayed otherwise Indian)" 2) Home > Services > Donate > Donate button > Redirected to Razorpay payment gateway
## On Azure Portal
